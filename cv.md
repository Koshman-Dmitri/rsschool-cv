## Summary

My passion for programming started at school. I have been trying to design website layouts. However, it remained only a hobby at that time. I decided to build my career in the industrial sector. But the craving for coding remained throughout life.<br>

For 4 years I have been working in the energy sector as an automatization process control engineer. I develop programs for industrial controllers and user interface (HMI, SCADA). I realized that all my life I liked coding, so now I want to change the field of activity. I dedicate my free time to self-studying for the front-end developer profession in every possible way and I hope to become one soon. I have two higher technical educations, a creative mindset, developed self-discipline and self-learning.<br>

I have successfully graduated RS School stage 0 and now I am looking forward to consolidating my knowledge and acquiring new skills.

## Code example

**KATA from CODEWARS:** *You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.*

```javascript
function findOutlier(integers) {
  let evens = integers.filter(item => item % 2 === 0);
  let odds = integers.filter(item => item % 2 !== 0);
  return evens.length > odds.length ? odds[0] : evens[0];
}
```
