## Summary

My passion for programming started at school. I have been trying to design website layouts. However, it remained only a hobby at that time. I decided to build my career in the industrial sector. But the craving for coding remained throughout life.<br>

For 4 years I have been working in the energy sector as an automatization process control engineer. I develop programs for industrial controllers and user interface (HMI, SCADA). I realized that all my life I liked coding, so now I want to change the field of activity. I dedicate my free time to self-studying for the front-end developer profession in every possible way and I hope to become one soon. I have two higher technical educations, a creative mindset, developed self-discipline and self-learning.<br>

I have successfully graduated RS School stage 0 and now I am looking forward to consolidating my knowledge and acquiring new skills.
